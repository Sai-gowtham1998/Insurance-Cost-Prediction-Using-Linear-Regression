# Insurance Cost Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting insurance costs using linear regression techniques. The dataset, `insurance_cost_prediction_data.csv`, is used to build a predictive model that estimates insurance costs based on various features.

## Key Features:

- **Imported File**: Loaded the dataset from `insurance_cost_prediction_data.csv`.
- **Check For Null Values**: Identified missing values in the dataset.
- **Handled Null Values**: Processed and filled missing values to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Encoded the Data**: Transformed categorical variables into numerical format for model compatibility.
- **Data Scaling**: Applied Standard Scaler to normalize feature values and improve model performance.
- **Model Import**: Used a linear regression model to predict insurance costs.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance and accuracy.
- **Accuracy Score**: Achieved an accuracy score of 71%.
